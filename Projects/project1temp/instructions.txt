Lemming Domination is a war game in which you control 
an army of lemmings and aim to dominate the world.

The objective is to simply build up your army as much as possible 
in order to defeat the endless armies you will be faced with.

The game ends when your army is annihilated.

Help:

Conquest - This is the main mode of the game. You will be faced 
with an endless number of enemies and the objective is to simply 
survive as long as you can without being conquered yourself. 
Careful management of resources and a bit of luck will be the keys 
to victory.

Marketplace - This is the place in the game where you buy items
that will aid you in your conquest. You can purchase items with the
gold you pilfer from enemy armies. You may purchase weapons, armor,or 
even more lemming soldiers with your gold.

On your HUD, there will be 4 trackers: Lemmings, Food, Gold, and Morale

    Lemmings - A count of the number of lemmings you currently have
    available to send into battle.

    Food - Food is a resource you will plunder from armies. It is vital
    to have as your army grows. Without food, your lemmings will die and
    your army will diminish. If you're running out of food, you may buy
    more from the marketplace

    Gold - Gold is the in-game currency used to purchase weapons, armor,
    units, and food. Without gold, you will be unable to expand and grow
    stronger. Typically, happy soldiers will need less upkeep, so keeping
    your soldiers happy will ensure fuller coffers.

    Morale - This is your army's overall happiness and fighting spirit. Morale
    will have subtle effects on the effectiveness of your army in battle,
    the size of your army, and the amount of upkeep they need. Be sure to 
    attend to your troops and give them a break every once in a while to 
    keep them happy.
